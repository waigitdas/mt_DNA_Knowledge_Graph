# Probes Targeting Multiple Positions

 There are some well known short base sequences that are used in mitochondrial genetic research.

 <ol>
  <li>The 9-base sequence with different copy numbers in different individual</li>
  <li>The 106-111 sequence is sometimes deleted </li>
 </ol>

The reports in the Excel file show more complexity than is commonly reported. The 9-base sequence appears at multiple positions.
