# Topology

The topology of the knowledge graph does not fit the current haplotree/phylotree model. The knowledge graph is being augmented by memorializing graph analytic results in new nodes, relationships, and properties. Patterns are emerging. The goal is to characterize those patterns and describe them using graph structures and metrics.

 Nothing to report publicly at this point. If you have interest in collaborating please contact dave@wai.mdWith a subject line of mt-DNA Graph Topology.
