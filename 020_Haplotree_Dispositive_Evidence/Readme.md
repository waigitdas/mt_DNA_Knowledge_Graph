## Dispositive Evidence


"Dispositive evidence" refers to evidence that is so conclusive and strong that it determines the outcome of a legal case or dispute, effectively resolving a key issue in contention. This type of evidence leaves no room for reasonable doubt or alternative interpretations. It can be used to prove or disprove an essential fact in a case, making further argument or investigation unnecessary.

The sub-folders provide several lines of evidence that are incompatible with the phylotree mode:

<li>Traversal interrupted in 97% by missing branch-defining variants</li>
<li>C16189T case study illustrates the role of misidentified variants</li>
</ol>
<li>Haplotree  Dispositive Evidence</li>

<li>The Dispositive Triad: a paradigm shifting construct</li>
<li>Dropped haplotree variants</li>
</ol>
