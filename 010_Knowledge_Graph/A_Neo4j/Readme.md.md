# Neo4j
 
The knowlege graph is build in Neo4j Enterprise v 5.26.1 on a Dell Desktop PC. The database is perse ~3GB in size and the server requires additional space. In general, the storage space fora graph database is about half that of a relational database. The current knowledge graph has an exuberance of nodes, relationships, properties and indices to support the research. A less exuberant environment would be sufficient for focussed projects.

The database will oon be available as a dump file, allowing it to be restored without building it de novo.
