## GraphCharacteristics

The mtDNA knowledge graph captures the complex topology of mitochondrial DNA through a schema that encodes sequences, haplotrees, variants, in silico probes, and their hierarchical relationships. The FTDNA haplotree and Phylotree differ slightly and serve distinct roles in this project; their differences are subtle and do not materially affect the outcomes. While the haplotree model is internally consistent and robust, its linear descendant hierarchy oversimplifies the complexity exposed by the graph. A deeper analysis reveals significant structural and biological flaws beneath the surface coherence.
