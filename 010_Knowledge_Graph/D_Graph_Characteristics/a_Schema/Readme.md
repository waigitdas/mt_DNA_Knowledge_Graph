# Neo4j Schema

The <a href="https://github.com/waigitdas/mt_DNA_Knowledge_Graph/blob/main/010_Knowledge_Graph/D_Graph_Characteristics/a_Schema/descriptive_statistics_20250401_132600.xlsx">Excel file</a> has worksheet with lists of nodes, relationships and their properties.  At the bottom of each worksheet is the Cypher query user to extract the data.

## Grass Files

Grass files are analogous to css files in html. The allow custom displays in browser windows for the Neo4 database and Cypher queries producing nose and relationships. You can have different grass files for various purposes. 

⬇  The grass files are <a href="https://github.com/waigitdas/Mitochondrial-DNA-Research/tree/main/010_Knowledge_Graph/D_Graph_Characteristics/a_Schema/grass_files">here</a>

To use them drag the file from File Explorer into the Neo4j browser window. 

There are several useful features enabled by grass file:s that are not available in the browser settings

<0l>
<li>colors for nodes and relationships</li>
<li>formatting of sizes and widths of nodes and relationships</li>
<li>displaying multiple properties of nodes and relationships</li>
<li>easy transitions between grass displays</li>
</ol>

To show the current grass file in use by the browser use  this command:
