# Probes Challenge the Haplotree Assumptions

## 1. What the Haplotree Assumes

### ✅ Mutation Rates Are Predictable and Uniform  
- The haplotree’s timeline assumes that mutations accumulate at a roughly constant rate over time.  
- Timeline calibration is based on known historical events.  

---

### ✅ Mutations = Inheritance Events  
- The model assumes that mutations reflect true maternal inheritance and define branch splits.  
- The divergence of lineages is dated based on these accumulated mutations.

## 2. How the Probe Data Challenges These Assumptions

### ❗ Not All Mutations Are Independent Events  
A mutation like C152T must be viewed in context. While it may appear as a new specific mutation, it occurs alongside specific neighboring variants that are inherited as a group. Probes capture this broader pattern, revealing more stable and informative sequence features than individual mutations alone. 

➡️ C152T appears frequently in population-level data, but for any given sequence, there is just one C152T. Its recurrence may reflect not independent mutation, but shared inheritance of a broader sequence context that includes neighboring variants. The data does not distinguish between these possibilities.

➡️ The probe-based signal suggests that mutations like C152T are part of inherited sequence patterns, making the underlying mutation rate more stable than variant-based data implies.

### ❗ Probes and variants have contradictory perspectives  
Variants are often used to define multiple haplotree branches. Probes, however, are created from sequences and are homologous with them. Probes show greater specificity than variants, with 81% aligning with a single haplogroup and another 3.8% aligning with a set of haplogroups within a single clade. The remaining probes align with more than one haplogroup or clade, which conflicts with the haplotree model and suggests that sequence-based haplogroup assignments are often inaccurate
